# simplecraft
Another minecraft clone, for educational and test purposes only.
## Note
In order to run this you have to own a copy of the original game which is available at https://www.minecraft.net/ because this project may contain resource files from the game.
By the way the renderer is very simple and not efficient, maybe I will fix that later.
